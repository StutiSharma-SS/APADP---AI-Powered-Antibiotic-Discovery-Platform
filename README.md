# ðŸ§¬ AI-Powered Antibiotic Discovery Platform (APADP)

> **Combating Antimicrobial Resistance with Artificial Intelligence**  
> Built for the **Bio-Technology Innovation Challenge 2025**

---

##  Overview

The **AI-Powered Antibiotic Discovery Platform (APADP)** is an innovative AI-driven system designed to **accelerate the discovery of novel antibiotics** and combat the growing threat of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**.  
Leveraging **deep learning**, **virtual screening**, and **resistance prediction algorithms**, APADP reduces the antibiotic discovery timeline from **15 years to 3â€“5 years** with **90%+ prediction accuracy**.

---

##  The Problem: Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis

- **2 Million** projected annual deaths by 2050  
- **15 Years** average drug discovery timeline  
- **$1.3 Billion** cost per new antibiotic  
- **<1%** success rate in traditional discovery  

**Root causes** include:
- Bacteria evolving faster than drug development
- High costs and low profits discouraging research
- Resistance patterns shifting within months
